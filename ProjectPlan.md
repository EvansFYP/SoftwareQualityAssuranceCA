# SoftwareQualityAssuranceCA
Project Plan - CA Overview
The team has been asked to research and write a handbook of best practices
to do this we will be covering the following topics and researching with 5 good quality resources,
the end goal being a handbook that is simple and easy to skim through which coveys information
effectively.

Three main topics are to be split between team members 

Task estimation in Scrum

Code reviews

Third Topic (to be decided by team)


# Task Estimation
Requires research on Task Estimation the good and the bads using 5 resources, 2 team members must work on this together. The resources should be more personal as opposed to professional articles on how to do a small part of the process such as "Planning Poker"

# Code Review

Similarly the research on Code Review is to be done with 2 members at least and will be using the same personal experiences as resources, it is important that the team is collaborating on their commits and pull requests.

# Third Topic: Refactoring
This topic will be decided by the team based on our own research and what aligns in a handbook for a company struggling with effiency across the board, the team chose Refactoring as the topic and as such the process of research and teamwork is the same as the previous topics but its important to remain consistent with themes.

# Project Planning and Structure
Split up group across the multiple tasks required with a clear goal of teamwork within the same file, important information or commits should be discussed with comments with your teammate to ensure there are no problems or collisions in the work process.


# Read Me / Introduction
To be done once everybody is done with their own work the Introduction will be done to create an overview of the project, it will be done in the README file for simplicity. It does not need to be done within a team as the others but could benefit from the team inputting an overview of their own section.


# Reflection of our work
This will be done when the main project is complete its a reflection our of work and what we would change as a team next time, e.g 

# Team contribution overview
at the end of the project the team can input into a table the work they contributed to the project, check the end of the CA description for an example https://brightspace.tudublin.ie/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folder_submit_files.d2l?ou=342231&isprv=0&db=204368&grpid=391103&cfql=0
