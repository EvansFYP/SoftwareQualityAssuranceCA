# Task Estimation 

Task Estimation is the estimation of how much time, effort or any resources are to be put into completing a task in software development. Accurate estimation helps teams work efficiently and meet deadlines.

# Best Practices

## Teamwork

Adapt Estimation Methods: Experiment with different techniques and choose what works best for your team.

Team Estimation: Involve the entire team for a more accurate estimate. Using specialised techniques outlined in the handbook will help.

Task Breakdown: Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable units using methods outlined in the handbook. 

## Communication

Communicate Updates: Keep all team members informed with any estimation changes to avoid misunderstandings.

Document Estimations: Proper effective communication especially in remote teams and when dealing with sensitive information, use tools to save these details.

Stakeholder Involvement: Discuss with stakeholders during estimation meetings this can help smooth out the process and answer questions.

## Management and Tracking

Track Progress Efficiently: There are plenty of tools available that specialise in tracking progress and visualising data, it is imperative to make use of these

Maintain an Organised Backlog: the backlog is important and its the backbone to any tasks and estimation the more organised the better, there are techniques and tools avaiable to help.

Risk Assessment: Identify uncertainties early, these are to be accounted for in the task estimations.

# Common Pitfalls / Bad Practices

Not leveraging the entire team: Estimations done by a single person tend to be less accurate.

Poor communication of changes: Failing to update the team leads to frustration and confusion.

Leaving tasks too large: Large tasks increase uncertainty and give a lack of clarity to the team.

Ignoring potential risks: The team must prepare for possible setbacks.

Sticking to an ineffective method: If an estimation technique isnâ€™t working, be open to change.
