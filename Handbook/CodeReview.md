# Code Review

> Code reviews are methodical assessments of code designed to identify bugs, increase code quality, and help developers learn the source code.

## Introduction
When a developer is finished working on an issue, they often will commit their changes for someone else on their team to review.
Developers working in a team will tell you that code/peer reviews are essential to avoid mistakes and improve readability / flexibility.
A code review is the process of going through a snippet of code looking for any obvious errors and essentially ensuring that requirements are being met.
> Code review helps developers learn the code base, as well as help them learn new technologies and techniques that grow their skill sets.
