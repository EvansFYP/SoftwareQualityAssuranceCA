# Code Review

> Code reviews are methodical assessments of code designed to identify bugs, increase code quality, and help developers learn the source code.

## Introduction
When a developer is finished working on an issue, they often will commit their changes for someone else on their team to review.
Developers working in a team will tell you that code/peer reviews are essential to avoid mistakes and improve readability / flexibility.
A code review is the process of going through a snippet of code looking for any obvious errors and essentially ensuring that requirements are being met.
> Code review helps developers learn the code base, as well as help them learn new technologies and techniques that grow their skill sets.

## Best Practices
It has been very known that for quite some time now that companies, especially IT companies or companies with IT sectors/services use peer code reviews to establish the
quality and effectiveness of the code written. Whether that means that the code is sent peer to peer or from intern to peer. This has allowed companies to save money and create
a more sustainable IT infrastructure where the help doesn’t require the need for outsourcing.
In a study by SmartBear, they reviewed the Cisco programming team, revealing that developers should review no more than 200-400 lines of code. This ensures a roundabout
for 60 – 90 minutes of code review will yield a staggering 70 – 90% defect discovery. The more given the less defects will be discovered without the proper time allocation for such
things. This may include bugs, breaches, backdoors or more. The measuring method was LOC(Lines of Code) and with this they were able to determine the rate at which code can
and should be reviewed.

Therefore it has been suggested by experts that inspection of the number of lines of code should not exceed 500! As well as the reviewers of said code should not do so for more than 
in 60 minute blocks as studies show that perception and concentration plummet after said amount of time! Setting goals and measuring metrics is also a great way of doing code reviews
as it engages and encourages individuals to fully test said code!

Authors of the code should note down any bugs discovered in the developmental process with the use of comments as well as keeping comments throughout the code, explaining the purpose
of the technology and why it is being utilized in this fashion!
