Task Estimation, firstly lets define before getting into the best practices. Task Estimation is the estimation of how much time, effort or any resources are to be put into completing a task in software development. The end goal of course being to help teams estimate how their deadlines and allocate work properly.

Now that we understand the definition, the goal of this handbook is to outline the best practices and also the practices to avoid in Task Estimation based on personal experience.
